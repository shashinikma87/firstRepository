No changes are made to the data.
The Workflow Rule is fired more than once.
Both the Apex Trigger and Workflow Rule are fired only once.
The Apex Trigger is fired more than once.
Explanations: 4 
When the user updates the record, the Apex Trigger will keep firing, causing Trigger recursion. To avoid this, follow Trigger best practices.

17. A developer needs to automatically populate the ReportsTo field in a Contact record based on the values of the related Account and Department fields in the record. Which type of Trigger would the developer create? Select all that apply.
Before insert
After update
After insert
Before update
Explanations: 1 4 
Since the ReportsTo field is to be populated after the Account and Department field values are provided or updated, before insert and before update Triggers would be required.


18. A developer uses a before insert trigger on the Lead object to fetch Territoy__c object, where the Territory__c. PostalCode__c matches the Lead.PostalCode. The code fails when the developer uses the Apex Data Loader to insert 10000 Lead records> The developer has the following code block: for(Lead l : Trigger.new){ if(l.PostalCode != null){ List<Territory__C> terrList = [SELECT Id FROM Territory__c WHERE PostalCode__c =:l.PostalCode;] if(terrList.size() > 0){ l.Territory__c = terrList[0].Id; } } } Which line of code is causing the code block to fail?
05: The Lead in a "before insert" trigger cannot be updated.
02: A NullPointer exception is thrown if PostalCode is null.
01: Trigger.new is not valid in a "before insert" Trigger.
03: A SOQL query is located inside the "for" loop code.
Explanations: 4 
The code fails because a SOQL query is located inside the "for" loop and SOQL Query Governor Limit has been hit.

19. In what order does Salesforce execute events while saving a record?
Before Triggers; Validation Rules; After Triggers; Assignment Rules; Workflow Rules; Commit
Validation Rules; Before triggers; After triggers Workflow Rules Assignment Rules; Commit
Before Triggers; Validation Rules; After triggers; Workflow rules; Assignment Rules; Commit

All changes up to the error are saved.
All changes before a save point are saved.
All changes are saved in the first Apex class.
All changes up to the error are rolled back.
Explanations: 4 
Apex transactions are automatically rolled back if they are not successful.


21. When would a developer use a custom controller instead of a controller extension? Select all that apply.
When a Visualforce page needs to replace the functionality of a standard controller
When a Visualforce page needs to add new actions to a standard controller
When a Visualforce page does not reference a single primary object
When a Visualforce page should not enforce permissions or field-level security
Explanations: 1 3

22. What is the value of x after the code segment executes? String x = 'A' Integer I = 10; if (I < 15){ I = 15; x = 'B'; } else if ( I < 20) { x = 'C'; } else { x = 'D'; }
D
A
B
C
Explanations: 3 
Since the first "if" condition was satisfied, the value of x is "B".


23. In a single record, a user selects multiple values from a multi-select pick list. How are the selected values represented in Apex?
As a String with each value separated by a comma
As a Set<String> with each value as an element in the set
As a List<String> with each value as an element in the list
As a String with each value separated by a semicolon
Explanations: 4 
The multiple options selected in the picklist appear as a String with each value separated by a semicolon.


24. Which of these is a good practice for a developer to follow when writing a trigger? Select all that apply.
Using @future methods to perform DML operations
Using the Map data structure to hold query results by ID
Using the Set data structure to ensure distinct records

Explanations: 2 


31. What must the controller for a Visualforce page utilize to override the standard Opportunity view button?
The Opportunity StandardController for pre-built functionality
The StandardSetController to support related lists for pagination
A constructor that initializes a private Opportunity variable
A callback constructor to reference the StandardController
Explanations: 1 
We can override the standard functionality of the standard buttons through Visualforce pages which use the same object's standard controller.


32. A person who does not have "View Encrypted Data" permission will see the field with masked characters. Assuming the field is in the page layout, what happens if he tries to edit the value by clicking on the Edit button?
The field will not appear in the edit layout.
The user will see only masked characters, but can enter a new value and save it.
It will throw an error on changing that field and saving it.
He can see the original value and he can save the record.
Explanations: 2 
The user will see only masked characters, but can enter a new value and save it.

33. A Position is a custom object containing details of each position. A Candidate contains the details of each candidate such as skills. When users view the Position records, they should also be able to see all those candidates who match the skills required for the post. A position record need not have details of candidates and a candidate record can also be kept blank. A position can be applied by multiple candidates, while a candidate can also apply for multiple positions. What can be done to achieve this?
Create a master-child relationship between them
Create a junction object to store both the values
Create a lookup relationship of candidate on position
Create a Visualforce page
Explanations: 2 
To meet the specified requirement, the Position and Candidate objects need to be linked through a "many to many" relationship. In Salesforce, this is accomplished by creating a junction object.

The record owner, a user with the System Administrator profile, and a user shared to the record
The record owner, a user shared to the record, any user above the record owner in the role hierarchy, and a user with the System Administrator profile
The record owner, a user above the record owner in the role hierarchy, and a user with the System
Explanations: 2 
Since the Grant Access using Hierarchies is un-checked, no user above the owner of the record in role hierarchy will be able to see the record._x000D__x000D_ Users below the owner of the record in the role hierarchy are not allowed to see it anyway._x000D__x000D_ OWD is private, hence only owners have the access to see the record.


35. Universal Containers tracks reviews as a custom object in a recruiting application. The interview score is tracked on each review record and should have a numerical value, so that hiring managers can calculate scores.

A validation rule with the VLOOKUP function
A formula field with the IF function
Explanations: 3 
VLOOKUP can be used to validate data with the records in a custom object.


37. A customer wants to add a custom validation to the "contact save" process. Before a contact is created, the customer wants to include the validation, which checks if the associated account is active. This validation should be active for all UI as well as integration requests. Which design accomplishes this goal?
A custom Web service
A "before insert" Trigger
A custom Visualforce controller
A client-side S-control
Explanations: 2 
Custom validations are written as part of the logic in a "before insert" Trigger.


38. How would a developer use Schema Builder to delete a custom field from an Account object that was required for prototyping but is no longer needed?
Delete the field from Schema Builder and then all references in the code will be automatically removed
Remove all the references in the code and then the field will be automatically removed from Schema Builder
Mark the field for deletion in Schema Builder and then delete it from the declarative UI
Remove all references from the code and then delete the custom field from Schema Builder
Explanations: 4 
Schema Builder is a good tool to view and make corrections in your database. But to delete a custom field, you need to first remove all the references of the field.


39. Where can custom roll-up summary fields be created using Standard Object relationships? Select all that apply.
On Opportunity using Opportunity Product records

40. A Developer wants to create a custom object to track Customer Invoices. How should Invoices and Accounts be related to ensure that all Invoices are visible to everyone with access to an Account?
The Account should have a Lookup relationship to the Invoice.
The Account should have a Master-Detail relationship to the Invoice.
The Invoice should have a Master-Detail relationship to the Account.
The Invoice should have a Lookup relationship to the Account.
Explanations: 3 
In a master-detail relationship, the child object inherits all the properties of the master object.


41. A candidate may apply to multiple jobs at the company Universal Containers by submitting a single application per job posting. Once an application is submitted for a job posting, that application cannot be modified to be resubmitted for another job position.

What can an administrator do to associate an application with each job posting in the schema for the organization?
Create a master-detail relationship in the Application custom object to the Job Postings custom object
Create a master-detail relationship in the Job Postings custom object to the Applications customer object
Create a lookup relationship on both objects to a junction object called Job Posting Applications
Create a lookup relationship in the Applications customer object to the Job Postings custom object
Explanations: 1 
A child record once linked to a master record using a master-detail relationship cannot be re-parented unless "re-parenting allowed" checkbox is checked on the field definition level.


42. An org has different Apex Classes that provide Account related functionality. After a new validation rule is added to the Account object, many of the test methods fail.

Create a method that performs a callout for a valid Account record, and call this method from within test methods.
Create a method that creates valid Account records, and call this method from within test methods.
Create a method that queries for valid Account records, and call this method from within test methods.
Create a method that loads valid Account records from a Static Resource, and call this method within test methods.
Explanations: 2 4 
Account data passed to the test class should be modified according to the modified validation.


43. A company has a custom object named Warehouse. Each Warehouse record has a distinct record owner, and is related to a parent Account in Salesforce. What kind of relationship would a developer use to relate the Account to the Warehouse?
Parent-Child
Master-Detail
One-to-Many
Lookup
Explanations: 4 
With a lookup relationship, child records can have distinct owners. With Master-Detail relationship, parent records become the owner of the child record. Since both Account and Warehouse are independent entities, there will be a lookup relationship between them.


44. A developer is creating an application to track engines and their components. An individual component can be used in different types of engines. What data model should be used to track the data and to prevent orphan records?
Create a junction object to relate many engines to many parts through a master-detail relationship
Create a lookup relationship to represent how each part relates to the parent engine object
Create a master-detail relationship to represent the one-to-many model of engines to parts
Create a junction object to relate many engines to many parts through a lookup relationship
Explanations: 1 
Since an engine can have multiple parts and a component can be a part of multiple engines, a Junction object needs to be created.
